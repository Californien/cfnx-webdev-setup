**Install `node_modules`**

_Run following command in a terminal to install all necessary modules and apply the changes you made in the_ `package.json`_-file:_ `npm i

**Customize `vite.config.js`**

_Open this file and specify the_ `defineConfig` _function as you want to. If you don't know what to change, you probably won't need to apply any kind of changes in this file. For more info, look up here: https://vitejs.dev/config_

## Commands

**Start the dev-server**
`npm run dev`

**Build application**

## Deploying

**Netlify**

_With Netlify you can host your website for free, but the domain will look like this:_
`https://domain-name.netlify.app`

**Hostinger**

_Hostinger isn't for free but you can customize the domain completely by yourself and the domain itself is extremely cheap (starts at 0.99$ per year)! Unfortunately, hosting the website with the custom domain is extra money to spend... (Best plan for small to medium websites: **Premium**)_
