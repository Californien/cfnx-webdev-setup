## Config

**Customize `package.json`**

*Go to the* `package.json` *file and change the* `name`*-key to the value you want* 

**Install `node_modules`**

*Run following command in a terminal to install all necessary modules and apply the changes you made in the* `package.json`*-file:* `npm i`

**Customize `vite.config.js`**

*Open this file and specify the* `defineConfig` *function as you want to. If you don't know what to change, you probably won't need to apply any kind of changes in this file. For more info, look up here: https://vitejs.dev/config*

## Commands

**Start the dev-server**
`npm run dev`

**Build application**
`npm run build` **-->** *In a* `dist` *folder should appear files, which you can instantly deploy*

## Deploying

**Netlify**

*With Netlify you can host your website for free, but the domain will look like this:*
`https://domain-name.netlify.app`

**Hostinger**

*Hostinger isn't for free but you can customize the domain completely by yourself and the domain itself is extremely cheap (starts at 0.99$ per year)! Unfortunately, hosting the website with the custom domain is extra money to spend... (Best plan for small to medium websites: **Premium**)*
